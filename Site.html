    <h3>This website is made for a school project</h3>
    <p>I made this website for a school project to prove that I can create a simple website. This project was a chance for me to show my coding skills in a practical way.

        The main goal was to create a website from scratch. This website is my way of showing that I understand HTML and CSS, which is important for making websites.
        
        The tabs you see on the website are there to make it easy for people to use. Even though the website looks simple, making it work well was a bit tricky. I had to solve problems to make sure everything runs smoothly.
        
        This project means more to me than just finishing a school task. It shows that I enjoy coding and making things on the web. As technology keeps growing, knowing how to create websites is becoming more important. This project is a first step for me to become good at making websites.
        
        By sharing this website, I hope to not only do well in my project but also encourage others to explore coding and see how cool it can be in the digital world.
